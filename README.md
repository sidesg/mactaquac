# Mactaquac DAMS
The Mactaquac Digital Asset Management Sysem is a minimal DAMS that indexes media files in a locally mounted directory and serves them in a web application with basic search functionality. 

The directory `support_scripts` contains scripts that will eventually be incorporated into automated background tasks.
